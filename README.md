The python file collects asset data of BTC-USDT from Binance API, including the spot price, 24hr volume, 24hr volatility, 24hr price change (%), and the market cap, and provides a plot of the 24hr price history. Then, both the metrics and the plots are delivered to a live URL which is updated every second. The appearance of the URL is rendered by index.html in the template folder.
